 Mapping application developed for integration with the Pivot Point Field Mobile App (3rd Party Vendor). The Auditorâ€™s Office uses the application for tracking and managing building and destruction permits, managing parcels under review by the board of revision, and reviewing agricultural productivity for the CAUV (Current Agricultural-Use Valuation) Ohio Tax Program. Designed using the ArcGIS Online WebApp Builder.
