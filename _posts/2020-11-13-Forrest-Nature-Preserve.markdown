A series of 11 maps displaying updated park boundaries and trails. The trails were created using GPS points collected in the field and georeferenced old park maps. Produced for the Seneca County Park District’s new park brochures. Created using ArcGIS Pro.

The series won 2nd place at the 2019 Ohio GIS Conference Map Contest in Columbus, OH.
