Maps produced for Dr. Stephen Tulowieckiâ€™s forest modeling research at SUNY Geneseo, **Analysis of Forest Composition Models in Chautauqua and Cattaraugus Counties, New York**. The first map compares the model results and actual forest composition for one of the species analyzed. The second map depicts the area of study. Created using ArcMap.
