In 2018, Chautauqua Countyâ€™s Legislature appointed a group of local elected officials to explore forming a Lake Protection and Rehabilitation District. The Chautauqua Lake Protection and Rehabilitation Agency was tasked with evaluating needs and making recommendations to the County Legislature regarding the potential creation of a Chautauqua Lake Protection and Rehabilitation District. If formed, the District would provide a consistent revenue source and specific management objectives for lake maintenance.
