Chautauqua County has over 400 miles of state-funded snowmobile trails. The New York Snowmobile Trail Grant Program provides funds to local governmental sponsors that engage in the development and maintenance of snowmobile trails designated as part of the State Snowmobile Trail System. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, through the Snowmobile Unit, administers this program. The Chautauqua County Division of Planning and Community Development acts as the local governmental sponsor, and prepares an annual 3-Year Snowmobile Trail Maintenance and Development Plan. This map was produced as part of the 3-Year Plan.
